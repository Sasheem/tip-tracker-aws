<h1 align="center">Tip Tracker Mobile App</h1>

## Inspiration
<p>I developed this mobile app to keep track my earnings per month as a bartender/server. In addition, I also work as an assistant manager some shifts so I wanted a way to track those too. I developed this app to allow anyone working in the hospitality industry keep track of their earnings, hours, and hourly rate over multiple time frames.
